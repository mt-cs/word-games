# word-games
Assignment 7 CS21A Python For Programmer Foothill College

This program consists of two word games, Pig Latin and Turkey Irish, as well as finding the number of vowels in the string.

Pig Latin is a word game that is mostly used by people for amusement or to converse in perceived privacy from other persons. A few Pig Latin words, such as ixnay (nix), cramsay (scram), and tupidsay (stupid), have been incorporated into American English slang.  Notice that in Pig Latin we need to move the first letter to the end and add "ay". 

Turkey Irish is another one where we look for vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) and place "ab" in front of the vowel.  For example, "here" changes to "haberabe".

This program will look for an individual character, called the key character, inside a target string. 
If we were searching for a key character like:
'a'
and the string were
"He who laughs last, laughs fast, faster, FASTEST."
then the operation of replacing the 'a' by a dash would result in the new string:
 "He who l-ughs l-st, l-ughs f-st, f-ster, FASTEST."
As you can see, only the lower-case 'a' was detected and replaced.
